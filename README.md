# The O's
**The O's** is a ladder & snakes game themed around cereal O's trying to take a swim in a cereal bowl as fast as possible.
After escaping the cereal box *(Title Screen)*, the players must select their representative character *(Player Selection Screen)*, with the characters spawning in front of the box right after.
Rolling the dice -- both normal and special -- to the finish line is the name of the game *(Game Board Screen)*!
Once all players reach the end, a ranking based on their turns will be displayed, with the winning O taking charge of the cereal bowl *(Winning Screen)*.

For the **Beta Version**, all screens have been connected.
To get from the **Title Screen** to the Player Selection Screen, you must press the SPACE bar.
To get from the Player Selection Screen to the Game Board Screen, you must select at least 2 players to be able to press the SPACE bar.
To get from the Game Board Screen to the Winning Screen, you can either hit ENTER *(for testing purposes)* or finish all turns until all players reach the finish line.

The game will also feature **Option Buttons** such as going back to the main menu, turning off the game, etc., however, these have not yet been implemented into the game.

Furthermore, with the special die for characters using negative numbers, the turns don't work yet, so only positive numbers can be worked with so far.

The **move method** for the players must also be fixed, since currently the player is unable to use crossover fields & take different paths other than the main path.
