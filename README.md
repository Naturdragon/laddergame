# The O's
**The O's** is a ladder & snakes game themed around cereal O's trying to take a swim in a cereal bowl as fast as possible.
After escaping the cereal box *(Title Screen)*, the players must select their representative character *(Player Selection Screen)*, with the characters spawning in front of the box right after.
Rolling the dice -- both normal and special -- to the finish line is the name of the game *(Game Board Screen)*!
Once all players reach the end, a ranking based on their turns will be displayed, with the winning O taking charge of the cereal bowl *(Winning Screen)*.

For the **Beta Version**, all screens have been connected.
> To start the game, you must run TheOs.java (laddergame > src > main > java > com.example.theos > TheOs)!

To get from the **Title Screen** to the Player Selection Screen, you must press the SPACE bar.
To get from the **Player Selection Screen** to the Game Board Screen, you must select at least 2 players to be able to press the SPACE bar.
To get from the **Game Board Screen** to the Winning Screen, you have to finish all turns until all players reach the finish line or preemptively end the game by pressing ENTER.
To get from the **Winning Screen** to the Title Screen, you must press the SPACE bar.
The game also features **Option Buttons** *(going back to the Title Screen & turning off the game)*.

However, the turns including **special dice using negative numbers** don't work yet, so only positive numbers can be worked with so far. This will be fixed in the future.
The player order in the game board must also be fixed.

The **crossover fields** must also be fixed, since currently the player is unable to use them to take different paths other than the main path.
Because of this, many bugs can happen when being put into different path through ladders & snakes. These will be fixed in the final version.

Lastly, more animations will be added in the future, to enhance the overall aesthetic of the game.

Some of the commits have been done by one person, even though multiple people worked on the code, since we worked on it together & sometimes used the same device with multiple people.
Additionally, Lisa Freund was unable to commit her code, so Marko Zdravkovic committed it for her on his device.
